  <i align="center">A Recycle Robot that uses ML/AI to sort through recyclables ♻️ </i>
</p>

## Introduction
Our motivation is to address the challenges in recycling by implementing a 7 DOF Robot for sorting various recyclables. Items on a conveyor belt have random positions, and the robot, equipped with a Lidar sensor, uses deep learning to identify each item's category. Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) and Simulation Inverse Kinematics (simIK) are employed to move the object to the correct box.

## Approach
### Building Blocks:
1. Differential Kinematics (To move the robot arm joints)
2. Inverse Kinematics (To move the robot arm joints)
3. Robot Vision (To locate recyclables)
4. Neural Network for Object Detection/CNN (To identify and classify recyclables)

### Implementation:
- [Brief explanation of implementation choices]

### Flow Chart:
[Insert flow chart here]

### Data Flow:
[Describe how different components interface with each other]

## Results
- Images of final implementation
- GIFs showcasing system in action
- Embedded videos from YouTube
- Quantitative data presented in tables or plots
- Qualitative performance discussion
- Evaluation against pre-determined success metrics

## Conclusion
In summary, we successfully implemented a RecycleVisionBot using advanced robotics concepts. Future development could include [mention potential improvements or expansions]. The project represents a significant step toward efficient and automated recycling processes.
